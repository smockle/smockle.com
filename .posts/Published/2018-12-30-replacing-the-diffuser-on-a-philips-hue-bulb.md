title: Replacing the diffuser on a Philips Hue bulb

_Author’s Note: This is not [a philosophy-related post][1]. The self-imposed pressure to write something unique and insightful kept me from writing at all. I want to write, so I’m temporarily suspending my philosophy project and writing about my other projects._

I received a shipment of Philips Hue bulbs with broken glass diffusers. Unwilling to trash the (otherwise functional) bulbs, I disassembled an inexpensive IKEA bulb to obtain a replacement diffuser:

1. I purchased [IKEA Ryet E26 600 lumen bulbs][2] and clear [Gorilla Super Glue Gel][3]

2. Using pliers, I crushed the screw base of the IKEA bulb, separating it from the rest of the bulb, revealing a circuit board inside a plastic-coated metal cylindrical casing

3. Using pliers, I pulled the circuit board from the IKEA bulb then, working in a circle, I bent the plastic-coated metal cylindrical casing back and forth until it broke into pieces and separated from the plastic diffuser

4. Using a small flat-head screwdriver, I scraped the silicone from the IKEA plastic diffuser, until fairly clean, then set it aside

5. Using a small flat-head screwdriver, I scraped the shards of glass and silicone from the exposed rim of the Philips Hue bulb, until fairly clean

6. I applied Gorilla Glue around the lip of the cleaned plastic IKEA diffuser, then carefully set it in the cleaned rim of the Philips Hue bulb, applying pressure for about 30 seconds until the glue set

7. I allowed 24 hours for the Gorilla Glue to fully set, then screwed the repaired Philips Hue bulb into a lamp socket

The IKEA plastic diffuser from the bulb I linked above fits well and diffuses the Philips LED light well, in my opinion.

Here is a photo of the finished result:
