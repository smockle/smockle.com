To support my goal of writing 52 posts in 2020, I’ve migrated [smockle.com](https://www.smockle.com) (including my blog) to [micro.blog](https://micro.blog).

I’ve encountered minor bugs—missing footnotes, incorrect colors in the macOS app, broken code fence previews—but the publishing experience is much less hacky than [what I used before](https://blog.smockle.com/2019/05/05/technical-stack-ii/). Although Gatsby enabled me to [load images more efficiently](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) and [highlight syntax more beautifully](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-vscode/), the simplicity of Micro.blog is appealing[^1]. I expect to hack less and write more.
